<h2>Section 1:  Understanding The Data Format</h2>

<p>
Here is a sample of the comma-separated-values (CSV) form of the data:
</p>

<pre>
newsfeed,128.32.206.55,*,119/nntp,518,471877,484982747,95359,41749837,567236,526732584

newsfeed,128.32.206.55,-1,-1,4,3,144,7,370,10,514
</pre>

<p>
The fields are as follows:<br>
</p>

<table border="1">
<tr valign="top">
	<td class="SM">Hostname (sans "berkeley.edu")</td>
	<td class="SM">Host IP</td>

<p>
Some things to notice:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Some ports have an additional text description.  Port 119 corresponds
to the Network News Transfer Protocol (i.e. Usenet)</li>
<li>Hosts that end in the given domain ("berkeley.edu") have the name truncated to save
space</li>
<li>If the port is "*", that corresponds to "many".  For example, ports of
<tt>*,119</tt> would indicate that the host contacted many remote machines 
on port
119 using many different source ports.  Similarly, an entry of
<tt>119,*</tt> would indicate traffic from source port 119 to many
different destination ports</li>
<li><tt>*</tt> can also correspond to "port 0."  Port 0 is not valid
for normal (tcp/udp) network communications.  Large amounts of traffic on port
0 that do not appear to correspond to a normal network pattern could
indicate invalid traffic used for a denial of service attack against or by
the system in question</li>
<li><tt>-1,-1</tt> in the CSV for ports signifies "all traffic not previously
accounted for" (denoted by "other" in the human readable format)</li>
<li>The IP will be repeated for the hostname if the hostname could not be
found.  This may be because of a transient DNS failure, or the host may
not have a DNS entry (which should be corrected!)  Read section 2 for more 
details.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here's a look at the same piece of data in human-readable format:
</p>

<pre>
(F Flows) (I- Incoming) (O- Outgoing) (T- Total) (-P Packets) (-O Octets)       
i.e. I-O means Incoming Octets

</pre>

<p class="SM">
(Note:  "Octet" is another term for a byte:  8 bits of data.  Octet was
coined to avoid confusion with systems that called 16 bit words "bytes."
Non-8-bit-bytes have been relegated to history, but the term octet remains
popular in networking circles.)
</p>

<p>
The same rules apply as for the CSV. version.  The data is reported with
suffixes as described 
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Section 2:  The Implications</h2>

<p>
When a host rises to the top of a report, all that can be said is that it
has used a lot of bandwidth.  That does not always imply that there is a
problem with the host.  In the example of a departmental web server, it
should come as a welcome treat to see that many people across the world
are making use of the information your department is providing.  For
example, this is the traffic pattern from a departmental mail and web
server:</p>

<pre>

</pre>

<p>
Notice the large number of connections (88,000) coming into port 80, and the
correspondingly large number of replies (85,000) and bandwidth (1386 MB) 
from port 80 to various ports.
</p>

<p>
However; it is not uncommon for a high-utilization host to be up to no
good.  Consider the following usage pattern:
</p>

</pre>

<p>These are both examples of hosts trafficking in large
media files.  In the first example, it appears the user has installed kazaa, 
a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing utility. 
</p>

<p>In the second example, the server had been hacked.  Systems within academic
institutions are favorite targets of hackers because they offer high-bandwidth
connections.  When a hacker exploits a vulnerability in a host, he is not
usually looking for personal information; it's much more frequently a means of 
gaining a staging area for serving illicit digital media.  Tools exist to
easily administer and monitor every action of a compromised remote computer,
including setting up an FTP server, a peer-to-peer file-sharing node, or
even to launch a Denial of Service attack.  For more information about
these sorts of problems, 
<a href= "http://www.der-keiler.de/Mailing-Lists/securityfocus/incidents/2002-09/0044.html">
click here</a>.
Notice the large sizes of the connections between seemingly random port
numbers.  Peer-to-peer file sharing programs are designed to vary their traffic
patterns as much as possible to avoid detection.  (Kazaa is often configured
to use port 80 so as to appear to be a web server).  Once a machine has been
converted into a file-swapping zombie, the hacker can just sit back and watch
while the machine does its work.  The traffic patterns of any subsequent
control commands can be another good sign that a machine has been hacked.
IRC, or Internet Relay Chat, is one of the most well established forms of
network chat.  Often times, <!-- I dream of music, of a river that freely flows
...and it sings a song, sweeter than honey, one everybody knows --> a hacked
system will interact via the IRC protocol with other machines to receive
control instructions.  IRC is not in and of itself a sign of a hacked system,
but it can be a clue if the system is already using a lot of bandwidth.
</p>

<p>Finally, consider this usage pattern:</p>
<pre>
Host                         Known Port       F  I-P   I-O  O-P   O-O  T-P   T-O

169.229.129.10                 Other:         2    4   192    0     0    4   192
</pre>
<p>The reports often contain pages of entries similar to this.  No hostname
could be found, and no outgoing traffic can be observed.  This corresponds
to a record of a scan towards a non-existent host within a campus subnet from
a hacker (or a curious, rude computer user) off-campus.  Notice in
this example the 18 scans to port 137, a Microsoft Windows service that can
be exploited if the machine has not been patched.  System administrators should
be aware that each and every machine (and even machines that 
don't exist!) on his or her network is constantly being scanned for 
vulnerabilities, so if a machine
on your network is vulnerable, it is only a matter of time before it will
be hacked.
