<ol>
<li>The port field may have special meanings.  See below.</li>
<li>A flow is a group of packets with the same source and destination as seen by
the router.  Roughly speaking, a flow if a burst of packets from point A to
point B.  Flows are separated at 15 minutes for accounting purposes.
</li>
</ol>

</pre>

The human-readable format's columns mirror those of the CSV version.  For
readability, they are reported in scaled units as described
<a href="http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/Units/binary.html">here</a>.
<p>
Usually, the "Host IP and port" field lists an IP address, followed by a
"<tt>:</tt>", followed by a port number.  This indicates one endpoint of the
network conversation.  There are also several special meanings that can be
assigned to the port number section.  An entry of "<tt>:*</tt>" indicates
"all ports not otherwise listed".  For example, consider the following:
<pre>
128.32.155.79:80      132.239.1.232:*        76  25K 1338K  91K  103M 116K  105M
</pre>
<p>
In this case, there were several connections from
<tt>132.239.1.232</tt> from varying ports to port 80 (used by web 
servers)
of <tt>128.32.155.79</tt>.  The various flows were aggregated to form this 
single
entry.  This aggregation is motivated by the typical patterns of internet
servers and clients, wherein a server accepts connections on a Well Known
Port (such as port 80), with the client using varying ports on its end.
</p>
<p>
Another special meaning is denoted by the "<tt>#</tt>" symbol, as below:
</p>
<pre>
128.32.18.151#11     217.136.200.176#11     10  17K 1466K    0     0  17K 1466K
</pre>

<p>
Some entries do not have a port numbers, because some internet traffic is
neither TCP nor UDP (the IP protocols that use port numbers.)  Such traffic is
instead reclassified by its IP protocol number.  In the above example,
<tt>217.136.200.176</tt> sent a number of packets corresponding to
protocol number 11 (very unusual...abusive network behavior perhaps?).  The 
most common non-tcp/udp protocol seen in these reports is the ICMP protocol 
(#1).  ICMP packets hold special information on the type and code of the 
packet, which are shown in hexadecimal.  The first byte is the ICMP type,
the second is the ICMP code.<br>
<p>
Read more about ICMP 
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/icmp-parameters">here</a>.</p>
<p>
The example below shows several "ICMP ECHO" communications:
</p>

<pre>
128.32.18.151x800     217.136.200.176#1      10  17K 1466K    0     0  17K 1466K
</pre>

<p>Netflow recognizes the ICMP traffic specifically, and uses the port number of
the destination to record additional information.  So, x800 should actually be
interpreted as the ICMP type and code bytes <b>in hexadecimal
notation</b>.  Referencing the above web site, we see that type 8, code 0
corresponds to ECHO.
</p>

<p>The human readable section also includes "<tt>*:*</tt>" and
"<tt>TOTAL:</tt>".
"<tt>TOTAL:</tt>" is as it seems.  "<tt>*:*</tt>" means "other" for the given
category on the left (a category being defined by a host ip and
port).  So, referencing the above example:
</p>

<pre>
128.32.155.79:20      128.3.183.99:*        68K  66M 51.2G  23M  925M  89M 52.1G
128.32.155.79:20      128.218.214.102:4655    2   22   888   39 45.5K   61 46.4K
128.32.155.79:20      64.54.98.71:*          24   50  2096   86 43.8K  136 45.9K
128.32.155.79:20      *:*                    28  129 65.4K  115 27.6K  244   93K
</pre>

<p>
The traffic-category of the last line should be read "traffic between port
20 on 128.32.155.79 and all <b>other</b> endpoints <b>not listed above</b>
(on local port 20).
</p>

<p>
Th above data corresponds to socrates.berkeley.edu, an interactive Unix
machine serving many campus users.  Ports 20, 80, and 25 correspond to 
file-transfer, www, and email traffic, respectively.  The usage shown above is
quite consistent with the role this machine is supposed to play.
