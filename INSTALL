Requirements:

Perl version 5.8 or above
NetAddr::IP (available from CPAN)
Cflow.pm (Make sure to build with flow-tools)

You may need to change the hard-coded paths to flow-tools in the script,
and you may want to provide a default flowdir and tempdir in the script.

If you have all those things in place, it should just work out of the box.
Put it in your favorite directory and fire away.
